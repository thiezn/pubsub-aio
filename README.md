# Py3morTimmy
Python3 version of morTimmy Robotics Project

Trying to take a different approach to the underlying architecture by creating utilising a publish/subscribe system. This will be used to decouple the various modules (sensors, motors, image grab, audio handling) from each other. Its also a good opportunity to understand the advantages and limitations of Python3 and get familliar with asyncronous programming using the new asyncio standard library.
